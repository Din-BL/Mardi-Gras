# Mardi-Gras

I created a front-end Mardi Gras carnival project using HTML, CSS, JS, Sass, Figma, and Bootstrap.<br>
The website captures the festive spirit with vibrant colors, animations, and interactive features.<br>
It's accessible and responsive on various devices.<br>
I'm proud of the outcome, and it showcases my front-end development skills effectively.
