# Mardi-Gras

I've created a front-end project based on the Mardi Gras carnival using HTML, CSS, JS, Sass, Figma, and Bootstrap. I wanted to capture the festive spirit and excitement of the carnival through my website, and I'm really proud of how it turned out.

To start, I used HTML to create the basic structure of the website. Then, I used CSS and Sass to add vibrant colors, festive typography, and intricate graphics, giving it a unique and engaging look. I also used animation to make the elements on the page come alive and keep visitors engaged.

To ensure that the website is accessible and responsive on different devices, I used Bootstrap to design a layout that is flexible and user-friendly. I also used JavaScript to enhance the user experience with dynamic features like interactive animations and countdown timers to Mardi Gras events.

I planned out the design using Figma, a powerful design tool that helped me organize my ideas and visualize how the website would look before I started coding.

Overall, I'm really happy with how my Mardi Gras carnival project turned out, and I feel like it showcases my front-end development skills well.
