                Mardi Gras is French for “Fat Tuesday.” It's best known as the New Orleans celebration of carnival that
                leads up to Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, the season of fasting and penitence during the 40
                weekdays before Easter in
                the Catholic calendar

                Mardi Gras, also called Shrove Tuesday, takes place annually on the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday—the
                beginning of the Christian observance of Lent, which lasts about six weeks and ends just before Easter.
                This means that Mardi Gras
                is a moveable holiday that can take place in either February or March

                Mardi Gras or “Fat Tuesday” is technically just the final day of carnival and lasts 24 hours. A day that
                is an insane culmination of carnival season that’s full of parades, parties, music, dancing, feasting,
                self-expression and lots
                of alcohol. However, the name Mardi Gras is misleading, because like Christmas, Mardi Gras in New
                Orleans is more than just one day. It is a whole season, a month or so of parties that leads up to Mardi
                Gras Day. The main
                celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and the day of Mardi Gras.

                What is the history of Mardi Gras? What is the history of Mardi Gras in New Orleans? Well Mardi Gras
                origins trace back to Europe. It was the French that brought Mardi Gras to their colonies in Louisiana
                at the turn of the 17th
                century. The first official US Mardi Gras occurred in Mobile in 1703, and arrived in New Orleans shortly
                after its founding in 1718. About a century later New Orleans Mardi Gras had established krewes, street
                parades, a carnival
                King and had begun the tradition of throwing colourful beads to the crowd.

                Mardi Gras is not held in a specific location of New Orleans, because there are so many parades and
                parties in different parts of the city. The most popular areas to go is the French Quarter, which is
                famous for the vibrant and wild
                celebrations. However there are some great celebration in suburban areas like Mandeville or Metairie.

                Contrary to popular belief, Mardi Gras is family-friendly event that is full of family picnics and BBQs.
                Children come out to watch the parades and float riders have plenty of toys and stuffed animals to hand
                out to the kids. Maybe
                don’t bring the kids to the French Quarter and Canal street where the celebrations are a little wilder
                but uptown or upriver areas have a more family-friendly atmosphere for viewing the parades.
